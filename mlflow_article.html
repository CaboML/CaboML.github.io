								<h1> Experience tracking with mlflow </h1>

								<p>With Mlflow tracking you can organize all your ML project experiences in one single platform.
									Read the article to know more and click the github icon to access the repo.
								</p>
								
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/mlflow_logo.png" alt="" /></div>

								<p>
									Mlflow is an open source tool backed by databricks. It works with several languages such as 
									R, python and Java. It was designed to be multiuser and integrates easily with Apache Spark. 
									 It has 3 main blocks:
									<ul>
										<li>MLflow Tracking</li>
										<li>MLflow Projects</li>
										<li>MLflow Models</li>
									</ul>
									MLflow Project is a tool to reproduce experience runs and 
									MLflow Models is a file format to deploy the models. From now on I will 
									only focus on MLflow tracking. 
								</p>
								
								<h2> Wine dataset example </h2>

								<p>Wine dataset was collected in the North Region of Portugal and  has the goal
									of predicting the wine's quality based on chemical features. 
									<a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality" target="_blank" >[source]</a>
								</p>

								<p> Please check the github icon for full code and analysis.</p>
								
								<h3> MLflow step1 - Setup + UI </h3>
								After installing mlflow using the console select your desire directory and run mlflow ui. 
								<pre><code>pip install mlflow
mlflow ui</code></pre>
								<p> After initiating the ui you should see an image like this</p>

								<div class="image main"><img src="images/mlflow_article/mlflowUI.png" alt="" /></div>
								
								<h3>Mlflow step2 - run the first experience</h3>
								<p> MLflow provides some methods to configurate the mlflow session, like:

									<ul>
										<li>mlflow.set_tracking_uri('http://xx.xx.x.xx:5000')</li>
										This is very useful when you have the mlflow client, running on a server. Which is something I recommend, 
										in order for your colleages to have access your results.

										<li>mlflow.set_experiment("Elastic Net")</li>
										With this method you are able to create sections, in order to better organize the experiences

										<li>mlflow.start_run('name')</li>
										The goal of this command is just to setup up a new run. You can also give it a name.

										<li>mlflow.set_tag("mlflow.note.content", "Greed search")</li>
										With this method you can add note contents to your runs. This is very helpfull in order for you keep track of small
										details of your experience that may not be expressed in the metrics/parameters/artifacts
									</ul>

									After adding this blocks you should get a similar structure. 
									<div class="image main"><img src="images/mlflow_article/runSetup.png" alt="" /></div>

									Mlfow has 3 main blocks to track information:
									<ul>
										<li> mlflow.log_params('name', object, step) </li>
										<li> mlflow.log_metrics('name', object, step) </li>
										<li> mlflow.log_artifacts('name', object, step) </li>
									</ul>
									
									Once you have the metric logged you would be able to make plots, that can help you choose the model. 
									You can compare the models. 

									<div class="image main"><img src="images/mlflow_article/modelComp.png" alt="" /></div>

								</p>
								
									<h2>Tips</h2>
									In case you use a problem with epochs, I advise you to use the step params, because it will allow you a better comparison between epock.
									The same could be used in k fold validation

									<pre><code>import mlflow
mlflow.log_metrics('name', variable, step)</code></pre>

									<div class="image main"><img src="images/mlflow_article/step_params.png" alt="" /></div>

									<h1>To sum up</h1>
									<p>MLFlow is a tool of activily developent, with great features. I currently use MLflow tracking on my daily bases.
										I found this tool when I start to have a lot of experiences, I felt lost between all the natebooks.
